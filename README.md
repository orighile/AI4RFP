# AI RFP Response Agent

This project is an AI agent designed to assist in crafting compelling, compliant, and bid-winning government Request for Proposal (RFP) responses. It analyzes RFPs, generates proposal content, develops pricing strategies, and aims to continuously improve its performance.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several modules, each responsible for a specific part of the RFP response lifecycle:

- `input_processing_ingestion_module/`: Handles RFP document intake and preprocessing.
- `rfp_deconstruction_analysis_module/`: Parses and analyzes RFPs to extract requirements and insights.
- `compliance_strategy_module/`: Generates compliance matrices and develops proposal strategies.
- `content_generation_module/`: Drafts the various sections of the proposal.
- `visual_element_integration_module/`: Manages the creation or specification of visual aids.
- `costing_pricing_module/`: Develops the cost proposal.
- `review_refinement_module/`: Simulates internal review processes.
- `output_generation_module/`: Compiles the final proposal document.
- `knowledge_base_learning_module/`: Stores and manages data for continuous improvement.

- `agent.py`: Main script to orchestrate the agent's workflow.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists project dependencies.
- `README.md`: This file.
