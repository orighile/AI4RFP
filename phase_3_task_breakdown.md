# AI RFP Agent - Phase 3 Task Breakdown: Advanced Features & Enhancements

This document outlines the planned tasks for Phase 3, focusing on adding sophisticated features by leveraging Supabase (simulated with local JSON for now) and Manus AI capabilities, as per the project roadmap.

## Phase Objective:

To enhance the AI RFP Agent with advanced functionalities that improve its analytical capabilities, content generation quality, and strategic insights, primarily by deepening the integration with a knowledge base (simulated Supabase) and implementing more complex Python logic.

## Key Task Areas:

1.  **Feature Prioritization and Design (Collaborative with User):
    *   **Action**: Discuss and finalize 1-2 specific "advanced features" for implementation in this phase. Potential features include:
        *   **A. Advanced RAG with Supabase**: Enhance the `ContentGenerationModule` and `KnowledgeBaseLearningModule` for more sophisticated Retrieval Augmented Generation. This could involve:
            *   Filtering knowledge base entries by RFP outcome (e.g., won, lost), client industry, or project domain.
            *   Implementing more nuanced semantic search queries (e.g., using embeddings for specific proposal sections, though actual embedding generation is outside current scope, we can simulate the query logic).
            *   Storing and retrieving "lessons learned" or specific feedback tied to individual RFP requirements or proposal sections.
        *   **B. Automated Strategic Suggestions**: Develop logic (likely enhancing `ComplianceStrategyModule` or creating a new helper module) that queries the knowledge base (simulated Supabase) for patterns in successful past proposals. This could include:
            *   Identifying common win themes for specific agency types or RFP categories.
            *   Suggesting effective responses or approaches to recurring or challenging requirements based on historical data.
        *   **C. Enhanced Knowledge Base Interaction & Analytics**: Improve how the agent learns from and utilizes the knowledge base. This might include:
            *   Storing more granular data from each RFP cycle (e.g., detailed scoring from reviews, specific reasons for win/loss if available).
            *   A (simulated) mechanism to periodically analyze KB content for trends or insights that Manus can then use to refine its strategies over time.
    *   **Deliverable**: A clear definition of the selected feature(s), including scope and expected outcomes.

2.  **Supabase Schema Refinement/Extension (Simulated):
    *   **Action**: Based on the chosen advanced feature(s), review and update the existing data structures within the `KnowledgeBaseLearningModule` (currently using local JSON files at `/home/ubuntu/ai_rfp_agent/knowledge_base_data/`) to reflect a more detailed Supabase schema.
    *   **Action**: Define any new "tables" (JSON files) or "columns" (fields within JSON objects) required.
    *   **Deliverable**: Updated `KnowledgeBaseLearningModule` to handle new/modified data structures; documentation of the (simulated) schema changes.

3.  **Python Implementation of Advanced Logic:
    *   **Action**: Implement the core logic for the selected advanced feature(s) within the relevant Python modules (e.g., `ContentGenerationModule`, `ComplianceStrategyModule`, `KnowledgeBaseLearningModule`).
    *   **Action**: This will involve writing new Python functions or classes, or modifying existing ones, to perform more complex data processing, analysis, and interaction with the (simulated) Supabase data.
    *   **Deliverable**: Updated Python module files with the new feature logic.

4.  **Integration into Agent Workflow:
    *   **Action**: Update the main `agent.py` script to incorporate calls to these new advanced features where appropriate in the `process_rfp` workflow.
    *   **Action**: Ensure data flows correctly to and from these new features and that they are triggered at the right point in the RFP processing pipeline.
    *   **Deliverable**: Updated `agent.py`.

5.  **Testing and Validation:
    *   **Action**: Develop specific test cases for the newly implemented advanced features.
    *   **Action**: Update or create new validation sections within the affected module files (e.g., in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block) to test the new functionalities in isolation.
    *   **Action**: Conduct integration testing by running the full `agent.py` workflow with sample RFPs to ensure the new features work correctly within the overall system and do not negatively impact existing functionality.
    *   **Deliverable**: Test results; confirmation of successful integration and functionality.

## Next Steps:

*   User input is requested to prioritize or select the advanced feature(s) for implementation in this phase.
*   Once features are selected, detailed implementation will begin.
